## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

This mod was inspired by a discussion on CoB about content removed from ToB. It provides the possibility of redeeming Korgan if Mazzy is in your party.

You will NOT be able to stop this redemption nor help it. In the vanilla game, banters between Mazzy and Korgan suggested the possibility of changing Korgan, and I wanted to keep it like the original.

It's recommended to start a new SoA game to benefit from the whole relationship between them. But I'm adding content only for ToB.

If you are starting new ToB game, you should have Mazzy in party before Korgan.

## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games: the original Baldur's Gate II (BG2 or just SoA) with the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2EE), the conversion projects Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT) and Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET).

This is a WeiDU mod, and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods. If you encounter any bugs, please report them on the forum!<br>

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **`setup-korgan.exe`**, un-install the previously installed main component and delete the korgan folder.*

*When installing or un-installing, **do not close the DOS window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.*

**Disable any antivirus** or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: korgan folder and a setup-korgan.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-korgan.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-korgan.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the component settings.

## 

#### Mac OS X

The The Slithering Menace for Mac OS X is distributed in the same compressed archive than the Windows one.

First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: korgan folder, setup-korgan and setup-korgan.command files in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-korgan.command`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-korgan.command`** in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Linux

The The Slithering Menace for Linux is distributed in the same compressed archive than the Windows one and does not include a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.

Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, **cd** to your game installation directory, run tolower and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.

To install, run **`WeInstall setup-korgan`** in your game folder. Then run **`wine BGMain.exe`** (or **`wine Baldur.exe`** for EE games) and start playing.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-korgan --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>
